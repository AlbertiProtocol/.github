## Alberti: Autonomous Ledger-Based Encrypted Resilient Trusted Infrastructure

Alberti is a cutting-edge social network protocol that prioritizes anonymity and encryption while ensuring complete censorship resistance, self-hostability, and distribution. Unlike NOSTR, Alberti extends beyond text-based data to include images, videos, and other forms of multimedia, recognizing that a single image can convey more than 1,000 words. Named after Leon Battista Alberti, a renowned poet and one of the founders of Western cryptography, Alberti leverages the Ethereum Standard for Identity Management to securely manage identities and private keys, eliminating the need for complex key systems.

## Use Cases
1. **Encrypted Chats**: Secure and private messaging for individuals and groups.
2. **Public Posts**: Share thoughts, ideas, and experiences with the world while maintaining anonymity.
3. **Backend for User-Interactive Applications**: Integrate Alberti's robust encryption and identity management into any application requiring user interactions.
4. **Online Games**: Ensure secure and private interactions for gamers.
5. **Data Transfer**: Safely transfer large files and data between users.
6. **Multimedia Portal**: Share and discover multimedia content while maintaining privacy and security.
7. **Unlimited File Sharing and Sync**: Seamlessly share and synchronize large files without limitations.
